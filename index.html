This training will teach you how to make digital media more accessible, and includes topics such as: making digital office documents such as Word and PDF accessible, adding closed captioning to videos, and reviewing websites for accessibility. Under the guidance of a mentor you will learn at your own pace.</p>
                        <p>Outside-IN will provide digital badges for each skill that you learn so that you can show your skills to others. After you have completed the program, you will be supported in finding independent work or in creating a resume to apply for industry jobs. You can train anywhere that you have access to a computer and the Internet. Access to computers and necessary software will also be provided at locations in downtown Toronto.</p>

We do not require a doctorâs note or other documents. No prior experience is necessary. However, basic literacy and familiarity with windows operating systems and computers would be an asset.</p>
